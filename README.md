# Jamf-Resolver

Resolve common endpoint issues for Jamf enrolled MacBooks
The goal is to be like MacCleaer but for Jamf stuff
Deploy the .mobileconfig profile attached to the repo before running the script. It makes stuff way easier
Don't put API credentials hard coded to the script, make them Jamf Script Variables. They're blank right now so I can test with hard coded, but seriously, don't do that.

This is all in concept right now but you're welcome to test. This honestly might not be a good workflow for stuff like DSER but I mostly wanted to test if I could do it.

Use at your own risk... but also, please test and let me know your thoughts.
